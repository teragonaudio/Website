AUNotes
=======

AUNotes is a basic AudioUnit plugin designed for keeping text notes alongside
an arrangement. Since Logic Pro does not allow you to have per-channel text
notes like some other sequencers, this plugin provides a quick way for you to
store extra information in your Logic documents.

To use, simply instantiate the plugin in the desired channel in your
arrangement, and type away. Your changes will be saved automatically when you
save your document.

AUNotes is compatible with Mac OSX 10.5 and up, and should work with any
sequencer which supports AudioUnits.
