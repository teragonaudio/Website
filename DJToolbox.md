DJToolbox
=========

**NOTE**: This software is unsupported and is no longer being updated or
maintained. It likely will not work on newer versions of macOS.

DJToolbox is a grab-bag of utilities for managing a digital music library.
Most of the tools are designed to help find missing files and to keep the
library clean and well-organized. The operations are all performed on the file
system and not the iTunes Library database.

DJToolbox also allows one to easily switch the library location, making it
easy to manage multiple libraries on the same hard drive.
