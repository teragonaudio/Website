Sometimes it's hard to explain the benefits of DJ'ing with Ableton Live
compared with more conventional DJ software. Or, why one should use Live
alongside their existing software for filtering and effects. After all, most
of the effects in Live are also found in Traktor, Virtual DJ, etc.

The big benefit of Live isn't that the effects are necessarily better, but
rather that they are much more *flexible*. Not happy using a conventional
3-band EQ? Well, you can build your own. Or use any number of third-party VST
plugins to do the same.

And on that note, one of the most powerful and unconventional filters is a
sidechain lopass filter. When properly constructed, it will allow you to
cleanly replace the bass end of one track with another. It is much more
precise than simply turning down the bottom knob on a 3-band EQ while you mix
in a new track, but it is better experienced than explained:

mp3 demo??

In the above demo, two songs with heavy basslines are mixed together. First,
each track is played clean for 4 bars. Then, the two tracks are played
together, with the first track's bass replaced, and then the second track's
bass replaced.
