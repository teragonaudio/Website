Spills, particularly involving beer, are an ever-present environmental hazard
for the performing DJ. One thing I've learned over the years is that you
cannot prevent spills by preventing drinks in the DJ booth. It's easy to sit
in the peaceful comfort of one's home and simply advise one not to allow
drinks in the both, or drunken people. However, in the chaos of a good party,
drunken people *will* enter the booth and bring beer with them. Odds are, some
of the people you are playing with will be doing the same. Banning beer from
the DJ booth is uptight and unfeasible in most circumstances.

Instead, like the weather, it's better to assume that it might rain and to
dress yourself accordingly.


Dress your laptop up
--------------------

MacBooks, which have become a very popular machine to DJ with, are
unfortunately quite vulnerable to environmental hazards. A unibody aluminum
case doesn't do much good when liquids can filter straight through the upper
casing. If you aren't married to the Mac platform, you might want to consider
a ThinkPad or something similar which can [filter liquids straight through the
casing][1].

Also, the plastic Apple logo on the back of the screen is an Achilles' Heel
for the MacBook Pro. Get a plastic cover for your Mac which can protect both
the underside and the back of the screen. Apple has a big enough advertising
budget, they don't need you to advertise for them at the expense of your
laptop. :) I've had very good luck with the [Incase][2] solid shells myself.

A keyboard cover is also essential for a MacBook, as this will also keep out
dust and dirt which is often found in club settings. I've got a simple plastic
cover by [Marware][3], but [Magma also makes ones with Traktor
cheat-sheets][4], which can be kind of nice if you're into that sort of thing.


Keep your laptop up
-------------------

Another bit of advice I once heard and pass down myself is to build a
[portable rackmount kit][5]. You can easily find casings for 2U/3U/4U
rackmount gear which easily snap up. This makes transporting gear to and from
shows quite easy, and also offers the extra advantage of having a single I/O
port for your gear (ie, one power plug + one audio out to the mixer). Being
able to manage your own power cables in a case saves a bunch of time when
setting/packing up your stuff.

However, the biggest advantage of the portable rack is that it provides you a
stand for your laptop so you don't need to hunch over the table when you play.
A 15" laptop fits nicely on a 19" rack, with basically no spare room to place
a beer glass. This has probably prevented more lethal spills from hitting my
laptop than anything else.

Furthermore, most of your more expensive electronics can be kept inside the
case and protected from spills more effectively.


Hug the table
-------------

You might not be able to prevent intoxicated clubgoers (or DJ's) from invading
the booth, but you can at least keep them out of your space. Before and after
your set, keep by your stuff and politely move beers a few inches back from
your gear when they are set down on the table. Don't be a jerk about it; it's
not worth getting upset before a spill even happens.


When the rain comes
-------------------

Yeah, spills are still going to happen even if you can't prevent them. If it
happens, be calm and don't freak out. Power off any effected gear as quickly
as you can -- usually just yank the cable out. If your laptop took a full pint
down the keyboard, well, it might do the powering off part for you.

If a USB controller took the hit, then shake it vigorously (like you were
trying to fan out a fire) to get out any liquid which may have entered the
casing. Go to the club's bar or bathrooms to get some wet paper towels and dry
ones, then give it a quick wash and dry.

If only a little liquid entered the controller, it'll probably be ok. My
Launchpad has taken two beer spills just like this, and in both cases I was
able to recover from it in the aforementioned manner and continue playing
(yes, seriously). However, if a lot of liquid entered the controller, you
should probably not power it back on again for the rest of the evening, as
this may cause it to permanently short-circuit. Take it home, take it apart,
and give it a good clean down. You'll be surprised how resilient most cheap
controllers can be.
