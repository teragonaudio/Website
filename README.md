Teragon Audio Website
=====================

This repository contains the sources for the [Teragon Audio website][teragon],
which is generated by [jekyll][jekyll]. Although the site is hosted on GitHub
pages, it could theoretically be moved to any other static hosting provider.
However, GitHub pages does not support custom jekyll plugins, and this site
requires pygments for code highlighting.

Therefore, the actual GitHub pages website is a submodule within this
repository, which contains only the generated static content from jekyll.


Prerequisites
-------------

To build the site, you'll need the following debian packages:

 * ruby
 * ruby-dev

And the following ruby gems:

 * jekyll
 * jekyll-redirect-from


Generation
----------

Run the script `_scripts/gen-website.sh` to build the website. The script
`_scripts/gen-product-pages.sh` will rebuild all product pages from their
respective READMEs.
